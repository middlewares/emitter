Middleware to send (or emit) a PSR-7 response object using `header()` and `echo` and return the sent response. This middleware is intended to go at the top of the middleware stack in order to get the response generated by the inner middlewares and send to the browser.

## Requirements

* A [PSR-7 http library](https://github.com/middlewares/awesome-psr15-middlewares#psr-7-implementations)

## Installation

```sh
composer require middlewares/emitter
```

## Usage

```php
Dispatcher::run([
    new Middlewares\Emitter(),
    // Here the rest of your middlewares
]);
```

### maxBufferLength

Maximum output buffering size for each iteration. By default is `8192` bytes.
